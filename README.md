# 🖐 ASL_detector
A python script that will translate sign language from a camera into English


# ❓ What it does
It will translate sign language to english, however, it currently only works with numbers

# 📌 How to run
1. Clone the repo
2. Open the ASL_predict.py file in a text editor
3. Wait for the camera to switch on and wait for a few seconds for the camera to adjust to the background
4. After the camera has adjusted, then you can put your hand in the region of interest and make some ASL number gestures
5. To exit the camera, press esc

## 📒 Notes
- The Datasets arent included in the github repo because github wont let me upload a folder with more than 100 files and there are around 5000 images in the dataset that I made
- This was a hackathon project, it is not 100% complete and ready for deploying as I did not have enough time to, but I will be sure to add more features and work on improving and hopefully deploying this app in the future.
- I still need to work on extending the dataset to include letters as well as numbers to make it more robust
- Contributers to the project are welcome if you have feature requests or issues, create an issue
